        <h1>Abhinaya Tanniru acts in a play</h1>
        <h5>Title: An Enemy of the People</h5>
        <h5> Author: Henrik Ibsen</h5>
        <p><b>Billing:</b>Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty penny</p>
        <p><b>Hovstad:</b> Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
        be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
        enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
        another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
        the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
        the Liberals.</p>
       <p><b>Billing:</b> That is perfectly true! I see it comingâ€”I see it coming; we
       are on the threshold of a revolution!</p>
       <p><b>Hovstad:</b> Hush! (Calls out.) Come in! (DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
       street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.) Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Stockman:</b> You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!</p>

<p><b>Hovstad:</b> Has it come to that, then?</p>

<p><b>Billing:</b> Hurrah!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Stockmann:</b>Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
    they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
    Mr. Billing!</p>

<p><b>Billing:</b>War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
    throats, Doctor!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Stockmann:</b>This article is only a beginning. I have already got
    four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?</p>

<p><b>Billing:</b> (calls into the printing-room). Aslaksen, just come here for a
    minute!</p>

<p><b>Hovstad:</b> Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?</p>
