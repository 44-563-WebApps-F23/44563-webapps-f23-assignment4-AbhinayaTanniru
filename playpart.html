        <p class="speech">Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty penny</p>


        
        <p class="name Hovstad">Hovstad:</p>
        
        <p class="speech"> Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
        be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
        enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
        another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
        the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
        the Liberals.</p>

        <p class="speech"> That is perfectly true! I see it comingâ€”I see it coming; we
       are on the threshold of a revolution!</p>

       <p class="direction"> Hush! [Calls out.] Come in! [Dr Stockman comes in by the
       street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.] Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?</p>


       <p class="name Dr Stockman"> Dr Stockman: </p>
        
       <p class="speech"> You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!</p>


      <p class="name Hovstad"> Hovstad:</p>
    
   <p class="speech"> Has it come to that, then?</p>


<p class="name Dr Stockman"> Dr Stockman: </p>
    
   <p class="speech"> Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
    they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
    Mr. Billing!</p>


<p class="name Billing"> Billing: </p>
    
    <p class="speech">War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
    throats, Doctor!</p>


<p class="name Dr Stockman"> Dr Stockman: </p>
    
   <p class="speech"> This article is only a beginning. I have already got
    four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?</p>


<p class="name Billing"> Billing: </p>
    
   <p class="direction"> [calls into the printing-room]. Aslaksen, just come here for a
    minute!</p>


<p class="name Hovstad">Hovstad: 
    
    <p class="speech">Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?</p>
