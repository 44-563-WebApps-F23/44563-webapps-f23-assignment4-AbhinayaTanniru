        <h1>Abhinaya Tanniru acts in a play</h1>
        <h6>Title: An Enemy of the People</h6>
        <h6> Author: Henrik Ibsen</h6>

        <h6 class="name Billing">Billing</h6>
        
        <p class="speech">Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty penny</p>


        
        <h6 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad</h6>
        
        <p class="speech"> Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
        be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
        enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
        another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
        the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
        the Liberals.</p>


       <h6 class="name Billing"> Billing </h6>
        
        <p class="speech"> That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
       are on the threshold of a revolution!</p>


       <h6 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad</h6>
        
       <p class="direction"> Hush! [Calls out.] Come in! [Dr Stockman comes in by the
       street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.] Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?</p>



       <h6 class="name DrStockman"> DrStockman </h6>
        
       <p class="speech"> You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!</p>



      <h6 class="name Hovstad"> Hovstad</h6>
    
   <p class="speech"> Has it come to that, then?</p>



<h6 class="name DrStockman"> DrStockman </h6>
    
   <p class="speech"> Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
    they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
    Mr. Billing!</p>



<h6 class="name Billing"> Billing</h6>
    
    <p class="speech">War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
    throats, Doctor!</p>


    <h6 class="name Aslaksen">Aslaksen</h6>
    
   <p class="speech"> And every prudent man too, I hope? </p>


<h6 class="name Billing">Billing</h6>

<p class="speech">The prudent and the imprudent—almost the whole town</p>


<h6 class="name Aslaksen">Aslaksen </h6>
<p class="speech">In that case we may venture to print it </p>

<h6 class="name DrStockman">Dr Stockman</h6>
<p class="speech"> I should think so!</p>
